# grotszch-graph-chromatic-number-calculator

A quick and dirty brute force tool for calculating the number of possible ways to color the [Gr√∂tzsch graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%B6tzsch_graph) with a given number of colors.

## Requirements:
A modern version of Python 3 and numpy.

## Usage:
Download or clone the repository and run the file `grotszch-graph.py`. Enter the number of colors to try.

The program can be used to find the chromatic number of the graph (4) via brute force by trying numbers from 0 upwards until a valid combination is found.
